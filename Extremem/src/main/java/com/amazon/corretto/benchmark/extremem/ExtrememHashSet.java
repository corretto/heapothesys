/**
 * Performs same services as HashSet while maintaining memory accounting.
 *
 * An ExtrememHashSet instance has long field (simulated_capacity),
 * float field (simulated_loadfactor), and reference field (ls).
 *
 * Though different versions of Java may implement HashSet
 * differently, this code assumes the following memory organization:
 *
 *  HashSet has a single reference field which is a pointer to an
 *  associated HashMap object.
 *
 *  Each HashMap instance consists of:
 *     an array of HashNodes (initial size 16 or as specified with
 *                            constructor argument)
 *     a reference to a set of keys that is consulted by iterators
 *        (For purposes of memory accounting, Assume this value is
 *         always null.  The additional memory required to implement
 *         HashSet iteration is approximated by Util.tallyHashSetIterator.)
 *     an int representing the number of elements in the HashSet.
 *     an int that counts the number of times this HashSet has been modified.
 *     an int that represents the next size at which the HashNode array
 *         will need to be expanded.
 *     a float that represents the load factor specified at
 *        construction time (or the default value)
 *
 * Each element of a HashSet is represented by a HashNode.  See
 * Util.java for the implementations of createHashNode() and
 * abandonHashNode().
